# the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
# address here, the machine will use the default value from anno sandbox.conf.
# NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in anno sandbox.conf.
# Example:
resultserver_ip = 10.0.2.2

# (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in anno sandbox.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
