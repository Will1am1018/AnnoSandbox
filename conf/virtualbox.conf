# specified ID you have to define a dedicated section containing the details
# on the respective machine. (E.g. anno sandbox1,anno sandbox2,anno sandbox3)

# IP address is valid and that the host machine is able to reach it. If not,

# (Optional) Specify the snapshot name to use. If you do not specify a snapshot
# name, the VirtualBox MachineManager will use the current snapshot.
# Example (Snapshot1 is the snapshot name):
snapshot = snapshot1

# (Optional) Specify the name of the network interface that should be used
# when dumping network traffic from this machine with tcpdump. If specified,
# overrides the default interface specified in auxiliary.conf
# Example (vboxnet0 is the interface name):
interface = vboxnet0

# (Optional) Specify the IP of the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in anno sandbox.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the IP address for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify an
# address here, the machine will use the default value from anno sandbox.conf.
# NOTE: if you set this option you have to set result server IP to 0.0.0.0 in anno sandbox.conf.
# Example:
resultserver_ip = 192.168.56.1

# (Optional) Specify the port for the Result Server, as your virtual machine sees it.
# The Result Server will always bind to the address and port specified in anno sandbox.conf,
# however you could set up your virtual network to use NAT/PAT, so you can specify here
# the port for the Result Server as your machine sees it. If you don't specify a port
# here, the machine will use the default value from anno sandbox.conf.

# specific VMs. You can run samples on VMs with tag you require.

# the end of the analysis instead of trying to connect to the non-existing
# anno sandbox Agent. We can't really intercept any inter-VM communication from the
# host / gateway so in order to dump traffic between VMs we have to use a
# different network dumping approach. For this machine we use the "nictrace"
# functionality from VirtualBox (which is basically their internal tcpdump)
# and thus properly dumps inter-VM traffic.
